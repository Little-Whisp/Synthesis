                Concept of Mono

            <p>
                When I heard we got to create a robot for this project I immediately got many idea's for the design. Even though the functionality was more
                important, I also wanted to challenge myself to make a concept I came up with actually come to live.

            </p><p>
            I started with a moodboard. I already had a few idea's for the design of my robot. Cute and bubbly, I wanted these characteristics to come back in the design.
                I looked up a few images and robot designs for inspiration. I opened Photoshop and put all the images I found in a moodboard. What made these robot designs stand out
                were the shapes they had, mostly round and the material was smooth and shiny. The colour use was also super important. I liked that the robots were very
                colourful and had very soft colours as well. It really fitted their cute and cartoony designs.

                The design of Mono
            </h1>
            <p>
                I had to keep in mind that I shouldn't make the design too complicated, because eventually I had to actually make it. I started sketching.
                I wanted to make something that has these round shapes and cute appearance, something that would be nice to look at. I made a couple sketches and picked one that stood out the most to me.
                The body was a sphere so was it's head also sphere like but smaller. It had three legs, wheels if you will. They looked like these pointy rocket stands,
                as if he was ready to take off and fly to the moon. It's face was one of the most important designs because this would give the robot personality. I
                kept the face simple, but I wanted it to have a charm to it. So I gave him big eyes and small mouth. It gave this very cute appearance. I knew I
                would be able to make this because of its simplicity.


            </p><p>
            I wanted to keep the colours simple, but stand out. The three colour that I thought would look good and give it a very futuristic aesthetic were blue, white and
                black. Playstation uses this for the Playstation 4, 5 and Playstation VR, and it looks very futuristic in my opinion. Pixar also used these colours for the design for
                Eve in Wall-e, in contrast with Wall-e who looks like a very old en rusty robot. The end result was this very cute robot that look like a little rocket.
            I knew the moment I finished the sketch that I would have so much fun with bringing this robot to life. I named my robot Mono, after the word monoscopic meaning:
                'Something that has been obtained by imaging from a single viewpoint.'

            <p>
                I was super excited when I could finally start with building Mono. After school I immediately went to the Action to buy materials and tools to make
            him. While I was in the store I started thinking about the materials I wanted to use. For his body and head I needed something round. I went to the
            Christmas section and look for a pack with huge Christmas balls. I found a few, but I would need to paint them. So I went to the art section and took a can of
            white spray paint. Our robots had to have the ability to drive, so I needed wheels. I went to toy section and took a couple toy cars. After I was done with gathering
            all the material I needed to make Mono, I went home to get started.
            <p><p>

            <p><p>
            I first started with making Mono's body. I took one of the biggest Christmas balls and started cutting it half. I wanted to put all wires and other technical
                components inside this ball in order to hide them. I did still wanted to have acces to the cables for if something stopped working or needed retooling.
            So I added a zipper from a jacket to edges of the two Christmas balls in order to close them and open them when needed. The black zipper also looked very nice with the white
            colour of the Christmas balls. I used this same methode for Mono's head. That I made from smaller Christmas balls. This also helped with giving the material a
            smooth and shiny look.
            <p><p>

            <p><p>
            As said earlier, making Mono functional was one of the most important requirements of this project. So I also made a design for the inside of mono.
            I wanted every component to have its own place. The motors for the wheels, the circuit playground, the battery and the led-lights which I wanted to
            hide in the head, because I wanted Mono to have glowey eyes. I put little cardboard planks in order to separate each component and keep them in their place.
            I also wanted to hide the wheels, but this was a little to challenging so kept the wheels exposed. I did still keep the three wheel design in the final version.
            After working on this project for a couple of weeks, Mono could move, make sound and give light.

            The assignment in the first periode for this project was, create a robot that could move. In the second period the assignment was to create a battle bot that could
            push another robot out of the ring. I made a couple test videos of Mono in action. I first wanted to control him through sound. This proved to be very unstable though
            because he would move by every sound made around him.

            <p><p>
            I wanted to make Mono's functionality better for the second period, because we had to create a battle bot that was able to move another robot from out of the ring.
            So I gave him better working wheels and red eyes, to give him an angry look, so it would fit the battle bot theme more.

            <p><p>
                I absolutely loved the progress of making Mono. I keep calling him 'him' and by his name, because he actually became real to me. This weird character I created
                for a school project was actually able to move, had glowey eyes and made sound. It came alive in a sense. I will always look back at the progress if making
                Mono and be super proud of how something I never thought I would be able to do actually came alive.
